Data Pipeline

======
Input

Receives the raw audio.
Does FFT analysis.
Clean and filter
	Remove harmonics

Processes cycle verification
	Tracks frequency of beat and verifies that the internal cycles matches the beat
	Tracks input and internal cycle to 50% and if they match, cycle is verified and it follows the cycle
	-> Adjusts on 50% beat, 100% beat, beat sustain length, 50% beat drop off

Base Beat Cycles
	y=h*e^(-(a*sin(f*PI*x)^2))
	h=height
	a=attack
	f=frequency
	x={ -(1/(f*PI))*arcsin((1/a)*sqrt(-ln(0.5))), (1/(f*PI))*arcsin((1/a)*sqrt(-ln(0.5)))}
	
	one for primary beat
	one for off beat
Melody Array
	bool[88] (for number of piano keys)
	global attack, sustain, release value
	global harmonics value

======
Process

Has multiple selectable modes
Holds different music states
	5 general states for dance entropy
Processes prediction as well
melody prediction
	inputs a melody and fits a curve to the melody to predict it's future form
